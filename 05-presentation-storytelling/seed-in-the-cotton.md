# One piece of my puzzle - America


To give you a bit of a background to my story, perhaps I could say that I had always dreamed of traveling the world and experiencing different cultures from the local point of view rather than from the tourist one. I had always found myself being mesmerized by the variety of differences in the countries around our planet. By the different appearences of people, the way they dress , the way they speak, about their habits, cuisines, about their spirit. 

## Out of the confort zone

After graduating from high school, I entered a university but after a few months in I realized that the major I was studying wasn‘t at all what I expected it to be. And so I ended up dropping and taking my chances by entering a cultural Exchange program called Au pair in America. A couple of months later I found myself standing at the security gate at the Václav Havel airport, waving my parents goodbye. 
And there I was, getting on the plane headed to the New World. Feeling so ready for the big adventure that I was so hungry for. 
When I look back, being it my first time away from home for a longer period of time, headed into the new and foreign, I remember that I wasn’t even afraid. Instead I was so excited! And honestly I was so proud of myself for stepping out my comfort zone. And I am still so grateful to my past self that I put the fear aside and didn´t let others to discourage me with their words  but instead believed in my calling. 

## The winds of the unknown calling

My first stop was in Chicago where I lived with a wonderful family of 3 guys. Being the only woman in the family, I enjoyed my half year there to the fullest. It was the time of many firsts. I learned how to make delicious casseroles, tutored by their German granny. A first time speaking my favorite language on daily basis, getting used to the new enviroment, being shocked by the huge packages of food in stores and sizes of everything- bags of rice, cars, houses, roads.. Starbucks on every corner.  Everything was so new and exciting. I also enrolled in a local college and so I got so lucky to experience the real american college life. Studying my, at the time, dream major: film and acting, alongside with German. I cheered at my first American footbal match, didn’t exactly understand the rules. Made new friends, coming from different parts of the world. For the first time in my life I felt like I knew what living was about. I felt like everything was possible. I was flying

## Explore the land, explore yourself 

Then after some time I felt settled enough and familiar with the city and its surroundings and I wanted to explore more of the land of the free and the home of the brave. My first trip within the country led me to New Orleans with a group of Spanish friends. We drank tequilla in bars on Bourbon street, ate overpriced beignets for a breakfast next morning, next time we made a trip to Washington rode a bike around the Capital,  or had the best veggie burger in Millwaukee
I was living THE LIFE but as I like to agree with Forrest Gump´s mom „Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you´re gonna get“ and so one sunny day I got into a car accident which led me to leaving Chicago and moving to NYC. There I shortly lived with another brit-american family, and attended acting classes in a film studio for a couple months. 

## Concrete jungle 

So here is the new chapter begun and I got to understand why New York City was nicknamed a concrete jungle. The city is an incredible mixture of all the cultures that you can imagine. Always pulsing, so that it would truly seem like it never sleeps. Life in the Big Apple was exciting, there was always something happening. I loved my time living there. Although it wasn´t always all sunshine and rainbows of course. I changed my view on the film industry a lot when in NYC, I saw the vanity of the people working in film and it surely shattered some of my dreams but I still felt like Kevin McCalister when starring at that huge lit up christmas tree on the Rockefeller square.

## New goals 

After a year in the city, I started feeling the urge to study again. Go back to university and reach some new goals again. And as we all know tutions at american universities are.. well pretty high. So I started my research again and let things naturally follow.. I guess I tried to believe in my inner voice and just trust the journey again. I flew to Czech and planned to get ready to apply for a university..  when within 2 months I got an offer to move and work in Paris.  And I accepted. So bonjour Paris! And that´s another chapter of my story. But that would be for another time. 

## Cliché time, wisdom time 

By sharing my story with others I´d like to encourage them to take a step out of their comfort zone as I truly believe it can bring wonderful things to their lives. I wish people trusted in themselves more and also in their own power to create a life of their dreams. Because everything is possible.
This whole journey to the States was an amazing school of life. I made lifelong friends from different corners of the world, learned from the land and its people, learned a lot about myself too, and I matured.
