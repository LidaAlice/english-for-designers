Lida Alice Weisser

An observer of every day life's details. 

I believe in the power of mind. Whatever your thoughts carry creates your reality. 
My soul is of a traveler. I love experiencing life in different countries and soaking in the cultures and vibes of those lands deep within. También me encanta aprender y hablar español.
I have a passion for a written word. As well as for psychology and various art making. 
Our planet mesmerizes me and that's what I'd like my work to mirror. I want my creation to stand as a message that will be passed onto people to educate them and create a wide understanding on what changes we have to make in order to protect and sustain our home, Earth.
