Copying. What is it to copy? Sometimes we're not even aware of doing so. And sometimes we are. 
In our modern era, there had been so many creative pieces already designed, written, produced. I believe that in today's age it's quite a challenge to come up with something completely new, something that wouldn't resemble a piece already created by someone prior to you. It seems to me that, in a way, everything is a copy. Perhaps a bettered copy, perfected copy, expanded copy.
