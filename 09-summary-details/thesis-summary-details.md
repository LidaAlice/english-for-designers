# SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING DESIGN IN COSMETIC INDUSTRY 


## Goal of the thesis and choice of the given topic

When deciding on the theme of my work, I wanted to come up with a topic that I would be personally close to and which could not only enrich its reader, but also myself during the research and deeper study of the subject. The main motivation and a determining impulse for the creation of my bachelor's thesis therefore became my love for nature and a personal effort for a gentle approach to it, which I then combined with my interest in natural cosmetics.
Today, almost all of us are aware of the global challenge we face as humanity. The crisis in which our planet finds itself can only be averted if we unite collectively and, in the shortest possible time, apply changes to our daily lives that are not even too great for us individually, but are enormous on a global scale and for the possibility of the existence of future life here, are completely vital. I consider the creation of this work to be a kind of mission to participate in informing and educating the public. Its aim is to pass on the words already spoken and to attach my own thoughts and ideas to them . The work invites the reader to think and consider the importance of necessary changes, stepping out of their comfort zone and deviating from ignorance. Collective thinking that takes into account the impact of our daily activities on the environment, the involvement of human creativity and the application of their knowledge are the only way to the future. Thinking "green" is no longer a matter of hippies, but a necessity for each of us. I chose the study of graphic design as an opportunity to learn an effective use of this relatively new powerful medium, which I perceive as a tool with the ability to move and change the masses. I want to stand for what I believe in.
