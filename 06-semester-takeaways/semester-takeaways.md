Despite my several absenses in a class, I really enjoyed this course and also truly appreciate your constant motivating feedback and appreciation given to each of the students. I feel inspired by the way you praise others for even a slight progress or a good work.
From our classes together, I've gained **a new knowledge of working with Slack and Github.**

And that also somehow expended my mind into looking at **words from a more of a technical point of view.**

Another great thing that I'm carrying away from this semester is **learning more about my classmates** by viewing their works and also their presentations about what's dear to them. 

I also liked taking the time to **think and write about given topics like for example Copying**

Last but not least, it has given me an **opportunity to reflect on myself and my work.**
